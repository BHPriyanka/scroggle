        This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.

        <b>Strategy:</b>
        \n\
        <p>
            Wordlist.txt is placed in assets folder as it is. In the Test Dictionary activity,  while calling onCreate , the AsyncTask
            class is used to run the loading of the wordlist in the background. A HashMap{String,ArrayList{String}} is created in the
            GlobalClass. This data structure is used to map the words from the wordlist. The loop iterates over the file line by line,
            considers the first two characters of the string, and adds it as the HashMap Key to the HashMap if its not already present.
            And then add the word to the Value of the corresponding key. </p>
        <p>
            If the key is already present in the HashMap, add the current word to the ArrayList value of the key represented by its first
            characters. And for the search process, check the key by considering the input word\'s first two characters, once
            it maps, check if its present in the corresponding ArrayList. Return true if its present, otherwise false.
        </p>
